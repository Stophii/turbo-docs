# Touch

:::info

On mobile devices, touch input is automatically handled as [mouse input](/docs/reference/rust-sdk/input/mouse).

Alternatively, for games that work only with [gamepad controls](/docs/reference/rust-sdk/input/gamepad), Turbo provides a "virtual gamepad" overlay when targeting the web.
