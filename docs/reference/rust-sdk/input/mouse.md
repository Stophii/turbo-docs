### Basics

To retrieve the gamepad state of a player, use the `mouse` function. The player is `0`-indexed, so `0` is player 1, `1` is player 2, etc.

```rust
// Get the mouse state for player 1
let p1_mouse = mouse(0);
```

### Convenience Methods

The mouse input is similar to a gamepad except there are only two buttons â€“ left and right.

```rust
// Get the mouse state for player 1
let m = mouse(0);

// Checks if the left mouse button is JustPressed (similar to a click)
if m.left.just_pressed() {
    // Handle JustPressed state
}

// Checks if the left mouse button is JustPressed or Pressed
if m.left.pressed() {
    // Handle JustPressed and Pressed states
}

// Checks if the left mouse button is JustReleased
if m.left.just_released() {
    // Handle JustReleased
}

// Checks if the left mouse button is JustReleased or Released
if m.left.released() {
    // Handle JustReleased and Released states
}
```

### A Simple Cursor

The mouse's position is also readily available. You can draw a small circular cursor at the mouse's position using the following snippet:

```rust
// Get the mouse state for player 1
let m = mouse(0);

// Get the mouse's x and y positions
let [mx, my] = m.position;

// Draw a circular cursor
circ!(d = 8, x = mx - 4, y = my - 4, fill = 0xff00ffff);
```
