# Introduction

Turbo is built specifically for making low-res, sprite-based 2D games as fast as possible.

:::info

Turbo is currently in early development with a single full-time core maintainer. This means your feedback, contributions, and games have a huge impact on our feature roadmap and the overall success of the project. With your support, we plan to make the greatest 2D game engine of all time &hearts;

:::

## Goals

Turbo aims to make it possible for anyone to create a game in any genre in < 24h that can run on any platform or device.

## Features

- **Every platform**: Turbo uses WebAssembly + WebGPU, so it can run anywhere (even headlessly)!
- **Never close your game window**: games hot-reload whenever code, shaders, or sprites are modifed.
- **Noob-friendly**: Turbo's built-in APIs are aimed to help you do cool things with minimal lines of code.

## Organization

Turbo's docs are organized into the following sections:

- [Tutorials &rarr;](/tutorials)
- [How To &rarr;](/how-to)
- [Resources &rarr;](/resources)
