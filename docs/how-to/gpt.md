# Use Turbo GPT

:::note

Turbo's GPT is experimental. There's a high chance the code it generates will have some syntax errors or bugs. We recommend using it as a starting point or as an assistant to help you workaround issues when you get stuck.

If you have an OpenAI subscription, you can use the [Turbo Game Developer GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-R4OO8SkIz-turbo-game-developer) to generate code for you game. Check out this demo:
