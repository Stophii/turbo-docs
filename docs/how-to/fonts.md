# Use Custom Fonts

1. **Create a `fonts` Folder**

- Inside your project directory, create a folder named `fonts`. This folder will contain all your game fonts.

2. **Put Fonts in the Folder**

- The following file formats are supported: `.bdf`, `.ttf`, and `.otf`. You can find a lot of great free fonts online. One site we recommend is https://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/gallery/.

When you run your game, Turbo will automatically include any font assets in your project's `fonts` directory. In your code, you can refer to these fonts by their file stem (the filename minus the extension).
