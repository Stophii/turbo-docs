## Walkthrough

::::steps

### Initialize the Project

Begin by creating a new project called `hello-world`:

```bash [Terminal]
turbo init hello-world
```

This initializes a Rust project with the following structure:

```
hello-world/            # Your project's root directory.
├── src/                # The directory of your code. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] -->
│   └── lib.rs          # The main file for the game. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] -->
├── Cargo.toml          # Rust project manifest. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] -->
└── turbo.toml          # Turbo configuration. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] -->
```

### Run the Game

Next, run your game with the following command:

```bash [Terminal]
turbo run -w hello-world
```

:::note

The `-w` flag auto-refreshes your game window as you code. Just be sure to watch the console for compiler errors.

Give it a moment to compile. Once it completes, a game window will appear.

By default, a new Turbo game will have some boilerplate code that displays, "Hello, world!!!". So our work here is done. Just kidding. We're going to jazz it up a bit. Continue on to the next step.

### Update the Text

Leave the `turbo run` command running. Open the `hello-world` project in your preferred editor. View `hello-world/src/lib.rs`. Inside, you should see something like this:

```rust title="hello-world/src/lib.rs" showLineNumbers
fn update(&mut self){
   text!("Hello, world!!!");
}
```

Modify the text, save the file, and check out your game window.

```rust title="hello-world/src/lib.rs" showLineNumbers
fn update(&mut self){
    text!("Hello, world!!!") // [!code --]
    text!("Yuuurrr!"); // [!code ++] [!code focus] [!code hl]
}

```
    {/* text!("Yuuurrr!"); // [!code focus] [!code hl] */}

It should now display your updated text.

### Add Some Style

The `text!` macro has several optional parameters you can experiment with:

```rust title="hello-world/src/lib.rs" showLineNumbers
fn update(&mut self){
    text!( // [!code focus]
        "Let's gooo!",      // Text to display // [!code focus]
        font = "large"      // Font ("small", "medium", and "large" are available by default) [!code focus] [!code hl]
        color = 0xff00ffff, // Text color (in hexadecimal) // [!code focus] [!code hl]
        x = 32,             // Starting x position of the text // [!code focus] [!code hl]
        y = 48,             // Starting y position of the text // [!code focus] [!code hl]
    ); // [!code focus]
};
```

## Conclusion

You've taken your first step into the world of Turbo — initialized a project, launched a live-updating game window, and styled your very first in-game message. It might not seem like much, but this is how every great game begins: with one line of code and the will to make something fun.

## Next Steps

From here, you're ready to:

- Build your first interactive game
- Explore sprites, input, and sound
- Learn how game state works in Turbo

Your very own Turbo legend *has* begun — let's keep going.
