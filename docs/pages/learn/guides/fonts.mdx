# Adding Custom Fonts

## Walkthrough

::::steps

### Create a `fonts` folder

Inside your project directory, create a folder named `fonts`. This folder will contain all your game fonts.

```
your-project-dir/       # Your project's root directory.
├── fonts/              # The directory of your font assets. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] [!code ++] -->
├── src/                # The directory of your code.
│   └── lib.rs          # The main file for the game.
├── Cargo.toml          # Rust project manifest.
└── turbo.toml          # Turbo configuration.
```

### Put fonts in the folder

The following file formats are supported: `.bdf`, `.ttf`, and `.otf`.

:::tip[Tip: Use Bitmap Fonts]
Bitmap fonts work best with Turbo. You can find a lot of good ones free online. One site we recommend is [BitfontMaker2](https://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/gallery/).
:::

When you run your game, Turbo will automatically include any font assets in your project's `fonts` directory. In your code, you can refer to these fonts by their file stem (the filename minus the extension).

For example, let's say you added a font called `awesome.ttf` to the `fonts` directory. In your code, you would use it like this:

```rs
text!("lorem ipsum...", font = "awesome")
```
