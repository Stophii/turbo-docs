# Understanding Network Code

## Overview

Turbo OS is designed for networked multiplayer games and services where reliability, latency, and state synchronization are critical. This guide outlines the key **best practices** for building stable and performant netcode using Turbo's APIs.

## Core Principles

::::steps

### Authenticate During Development

To upload and update programs, you must run your project as an **authenticated user**:

```sh
turbo run -w --user <YOUR_USER_ID>
```

:::note
Using the `--guest` flag will not allow you to upload program updates
:::

Your user ID and authentication code can be found in your [Turbo OS Dashboard](https://os.turbo.computer/dashboard).

---

### Get a Fresh Channel Connection Each Frame

Channel subscriptions are **poll-based**, not event-driven. Call `Channel::subscribe` every update frame to maintain the connection.

```rs
if let Some(conn) = MyChannel::subscribe("default") {
    while let Ok(msg) = conn.recv() {
        log!("Received: {:?}", msg);
    }
}
```

:::warning
You won't stay connected unless you call `subscribe()` **each frame**.
:::

---

### Watch Files Each Frame

File updates is **push-based**. You must `watch()` files in every update loop to receive updates:

```rs
let counter = Counter::watch("counter")
    .parse()
    .unwrap_or(Counter { value: 0 });
```

:::warning
Loading a file takes more than one frame (~16ms). Be sure to call `watch()` **each frame**.

### Gate Messages Behind User Intent

**Do not execute commands or send channel messages each frame.**

Always check for a deliberate player action first:

```rs
if gamepad::get(0).start.just_pressed() {
    let cmd = Ping;
    let _ = conn.send(&cmd);
}
```

---

### Commands vs Channels

- **Use Commands when:**

  - You are writing to a file or mutating program state.
  - You want the server to store a result and keep a track record of player actions.
  - Player actions are discrete and not latency-sensitive (e.g. "cast spell", "equip item").

- **Use Channels when:**
  - You need real-time communication (e.g. player position, chat, combat).
  - You want broadcast behavior (multiple clients receive).
  - Latency is critical and persistent state isn't required.

**Summary**
At the cost of latency, Commands support a larger total number of players, persistent game data, robust player analytics, and a verifiable track record of in-game transactions. If you are more concerned with latency and your game state is ephemeral, Channels are typically a better choice. Channels are also a recommended default if you are not sure where to start.

:::tip
You can combine both. For example: use a channel for combat actions, and commands to commit kills or rewards.

### Optimize Communication

Efficient message design is critical for fast-paced gameplay and scalability. Small, infrequent messages reduce latency, lower bandwidth usage, and increase the number of players your game can support.

#### ðŸ§  General Principles

- **Minimize data size**  
  Keep your `Send` and `Recv` structs and enums as small as possibleâ€”remove unused fields and prefer compact types like `u8` and `bool` where possible. Be cautious of fields that can grow to any size such as `String`, `Vec`, `HashMap`, `BTreeMap`, etc.

- **Avoid chatty behavior**  
  Do not send messages every frame. Only send when there is meaningful state change or clear player intent.

- **Use intervals, not floods**  
  Broadcast shared state or sync events every 100-200ms ideally, not on every tick.

- **Prefer delta over full state**  
  Only send what's changed. Full dumps are rarely necessary.

- **Simulate locally**  
  Use client-side prediction and smoothing (e.g. tweens, lerps) to handle visual continuity.

#### ðŸš¦ Client Messaging Tips

- **Throttle**  
  Enforce cooldowns or time windows between repeated messages, e.g. one message per 200ms.

- **Debounce**  
  Wait for a burst of inputs to settle before sending a single representative message.

- **Deduplicate**  
  Avoid sending repeated identical messages (e.g. holding a key should not fire the same action every frame).

- **Gate behind intent**  
  All messagesâ€”whether commands or channel sendsâ€”should be driven by clear user input (e.g. a button press), not polling or idle animations.

Well-designed message protocols are the difference between a game that feels snappy and one that crumbles under real-world latency.

### Design for Errors

Turbo OS gives you fast, reliable toolsâ€”but real networks are messy. You canâ€™t control every playerâ€™s connection. Plan for failure.

**Common issues:**

- Players can disconnect at unexpected times
- Slow or unstable connections are common
- Server-side issues can cause temporary degradation
- Messages do not arrive at the same time for all players
- Even reliable timers do not guarantee synchronized delivery

**Best practices:**

- Clean up state when players disconnect
- Handle idle or inactive players to prevent blocking others
- Never assume successâ€”always handle both `Ok` and `Err`
- Avoid `unwrap()` and use clear error handling
- Expect messages to arrive late or out-of-order
- Read your logsâ€”they are your best debugging tool

:::tip[Use the Inspector]
Every channel connection prints a URL to its live inspector. Use it to monitor state, events, and logs in real time.
