# Debugging Your Code [Ore no na wa Erā da…]

## Overview

Whether you're tracing logic bugs, inspecting runtime values, or verifying rendering behavior, Turbo gives you the tools to observe your game's inner state without leaving the dev loop.

## Logging Data

Turbo's logging system prints directly to your terminal, making it easy to trace variable values, game state, and behavior during runtime. Whether you're narrowing down a bug or watching a value evolve, `log!` is your go-to for visibility without disruption.

:::code-group

```rust [Your Game Code]
let some_var = "foo";
log!("one value: {:?}", some_var);

let another_var = 42;
log!("multiple values: {:?} {:?}", some_var, another_var);
```

```bash [Console Output]
[turbo] one value: "foo"
[turbo] multiple values: "foo" 42
```
