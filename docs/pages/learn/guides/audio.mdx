# Playing Music & Sounds

## Walkthrough

Follow these simple steps to integrate sound into your Turbo game:

::::steps

### Create an `audio` folder

Inside your project directory, create a folder named `audio`. This folder will contain all your sound files.

```
your-project-dir/       # Your project's root directory.
├── audio/              # The directory of your audio assets. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] [!code ++] -->
├── src/                # The directory of your code.
│   └── lib.rs          # The main file for the game.
├── Cargo.toml          # Rust project manifest.
└── turbo.toml          # Turbo configuration.
```

### Put audio files in the folder

The following file formats are supported: `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.ogg`, and `.flac`.

:::warning[Pay Attention to File Sizes]
Large and/or unused audio files can bloat your game size and cause long load times or even errors on the web. Make sure audio files are as small as possible and remove audio files that aren't being used in your game.
:::

### Make some noise

#### One-Shot Sound Effects

Use `audio::play` to play a sound effect from your audio folder. For example, if your sound effect is named `coin.wav`:

```rs
audio::play("coin")
```

#### Looping Audio Tracks

You can loop audio by checking if the audio track has stopped playing and restarting it if so:

```rust
if !audio::is_playing("background_music") {
    audio::play("background_music");
}
```

#### Pausing and Stopping

Pausing a track, will stop it from playing. When resumed with `audio::play`, it will continue from the point at which it was paused.

```rust
audio::pause("background_music");
```

Pausing a track, will stop it from playing. When resumed with `audio::play`, it will restart from the beginning.

```rust
audio::stop("background_music");
```
