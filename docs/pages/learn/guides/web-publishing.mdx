# Publishing to the Web

## Walkthrough

::::steps

### Export the Game

Run [`turbo export`](/learn/guides/cli). This will create a `www` directory with the files required to run your game on the web.

```
your-project-dir/       # Your project's root directory.
├── www/                # The files needed to run your game on the web. <!-- [!code focus] [!code hl] [!code ++] -->
├── src/                # The directory of your code.
│   └── lib.rs          # The main file for the game.
├── Cargo.toml          # Rust project manifest.
└── turbo.toml          # Turbo configuration.
```

### Upload the Files

Upload the `www` dir to a hosting service.

:::tip[Tip: Free Web Hosting Services]
There are many options to host websites online for free. Here are some recommendations:

- **Netlify**: One simple option that lets you simply drag-and-drop the `www` directory is https://app.netlify.com/drop.
- **Itch**: If you have an [itch.io](https://itch.io) account, you can also upload a new project at https://itch.io/game/new. Be sure to change the "Kind of project" to `HTML` and zip the `www` directory before uploading it.
