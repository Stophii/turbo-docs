## Overview

Turbo is a _command-line based_ game engine powered by WebAssembly and WebGPU.

At this stage of development, Turbo is best suited for folks who have some basic coding skills. However, you can be an effective Turbo developer as long as you are willing to:

###### ✅ Make a 2D Game

Turbo uses a quad-based render pipeline and solely focuses on low-res 2D games of any genre. It has no 3D features.
