# Time

## Overview

Turbo provides two main APIs for dealing with time: `tick` which provides monotonic time and `time::now` which provides a unix timestamp.

In the context of game development and operating systems, "monotonic time" refers to a clock that always moves forward at a consistent rate, unaffected by system time adjustments or daylight saving time, ensuring accurate elapsed time measurements

:::tip
In general, `tick` is the better default choice for most game logic since it provides more granular values than unix timestamps. The monotonic values from `tick` also helps prevent and fix bugs since they are deterministic - equivalent to the number elapsed frames of your game - and have no possibility of changing mid-game-loop. Prefer `time::now` when displaying clock time to a user or calculating time relative to another unix timestamp.

## API

### `tick`

Returns the number of times the game loop has executed so far.

```rs
tick() -> u32
```

### `time::now`

Returns a unix timestamp.

```rs
time::now() -> u32
```
