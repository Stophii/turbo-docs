# Log

## Overview

You can log messages to your console while the game is running via the `log!` macro.

## API

### `log!`

Logs a message to the `stdout` on native and to the devtools console on web.

```rust
log!(&str, ...args)
```

## Usage

:::tip[Avoid Noisy Logs]
You probably don't want to log a value every frame of your game loop. It can clutter your console and prevent you from seeing the useful information you may be looking for. Instead, try including logs only when a specific action happens such as a keypress or mouse click.

### Log a static message

```rust
log!("hello!");
```

### Interpolate variables

Log your game state:

```rust
let state = GameState::new();
log!("My game state = {:?}", state);
```

You can interpolate multiple vars:

```rust
let (canvas_width, canvas_height) = canvas::resolution();
log!("Canvas - width = {:?}, height = {:?}", canvas_width, canvas_height);
```
