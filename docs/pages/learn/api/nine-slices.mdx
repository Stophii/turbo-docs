You can use nine-slice sprites to create UI elements, like buttons and text boxes, that can be resized without distorting the borders.

## `nine_slice!`

Draws a nine-slice sprite to the game's canvas.

```rs
nine_slice!(
    name: &str,
    margins = (u32, u32, u32, u32)
    x = i32,
    y = i32,
    w = u32,
    h = u32,
    fixed = true,
    bounds = Bounds,
)
```

| Param     | Type                   | Default | Description                                                                 |
| :-------- | :--------------------- | :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`    | `&str`                 |         | Name of the sprite to use as a nine-slice.                                  |
| `margins` | `(u32, u32, u32, u32)` | `0`     | The margins of the nine-slice sprite.                                       |
| `x`       | `i32`                  | `0`     | X position of the nine-slice.                                               |
| `y`       | `i32`                  | `0`     | Y position of the nine-slice.                                               |
| `w`       | `u32`                  | `0`     | The width of the nine-slice.                                                |
| `h`       | `u32`                  | `0`     | The height of the nine-slice.                                               |
| `fixed`   | `bool`                 | `false` | If `true`, the nine-slice's size and position are unaffected by the camera. |
| `bounds`  | `Bounds`               |         | Sets the `x`, `y`, `w`, `h` of the nine-slice.                              |

:::note
To render a nine-slice turbo needs to know the sprite file name and the margins. The margins are the distances in pixels of each edge, starting from the left and moving clockwise.

:::tip[Example]

To draw a nine-slice, call the macro like this:

```rust
nine_slice!(
    "nslice_sprite_name",
    margins = (8, 8, 8, 8),
    x = 28,
    y = 20,
    w = 200,
    h = 50
);
```
