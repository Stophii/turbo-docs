# Events

## Overview

`Events` will allow you to send an event from Turbo. This will allow the integration of API's or JS events from websites. 

## API

### `events::emit`

This will send an event that you can read from your `main.js` after you export your game. 

```rust
events::emit(name: &str, data: &str)
```

## Usage

### Calling Ads

Then, after you export, you add code to your `main.js` file. You can put this code at the top.

```rust
window.addEventListener("turboGameEvent", (e) => {
    console.log(e.detail);

    // Check for the name of the event, and perform the required action
    if (e.detail && e.detail.name === "preroll_ad") {
      //This will fire when your turbo event is called in the game
      console.log("Detected Preroll Ad Event");
      }
    }
   }

await turbo.run(canvas, contents);
```

### Pausing and Resuming

Pause your game with

```rust
window.turbo.pause();
```

Resume your game with 

```rust
window.turbo.resume();
```
