# Channels

![Two ghosts sharing a computer](/ghosts_at_computer.png)

## Overview

The `channel` API lets your game subscribe to a Turbo OS channel to send and receive incoming messages asynchronously. Channels are good for fast-paced multiplayer gameplay and other features that require low latency + group broadcasts such as chat.

:::warning
Make sure your have the latest CLI and SDK versions:

1. Install the latest CLI:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://turbo.computer/install.sh | TURBO_VERSION=0.8.0-alpha.10 sh
```

2. Update your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
turbo = { version = "4.0.0-alpha.36", package = "turbo-genesis-sdk" }
```

## Creating a Channel (Server)

To demonstrate, let's make a "ping pong" channel that accepts "ping" messages and sends back "pong" messages in response:

### Create Send and Recv types for the channel

Let's define our `Ping` and `Pong` structs:

```rs
use turbo::*;

#[turbo::serialize]
pub struct Ping;

#[turbo::serialize]
pub struct Pong;
```

We will send `Ping` to the channel and receive `Pong` from the channel.

### Use the Channel macro

Here, we use the `turbo::os::channel` macro to tag our ChannelHandler with program and channel names.

```rs
use turbo::*;

#[turbo::serialize]
pub struct Ping;

#[turbo::serialize]
pub struct Pong;

#[turbo::os::channel(program = "pingpong", name = "main")] // [!code focus] [!code hl]
pub struct PingPongChannel; // [!code focus] [!code hl]
```

:::note
The macro will ensure our program is uploaded and will add an additional `subscribe` method to `PingPongChannel` which will be useful when interacting with the channel on the client side.
:::

### Implement `ChannelHandler`

Next, we have to implement the `ChannelHandler` trait:

```rs
use turbo::*;

#[turbo::serialize]
pub struct Ping;

#[turbo::serialize]
pub struct Pong;

#[turbo::os::channel(program = "pingpong", name = "main")]
pub struct PingPongChannel;
impl ChannelHandler for PingPongChannel { // [!code focus] [!code hl]
    type Recv = Ping; // incoming from client [!code focus] [!code hl]
    type Send = Pong; // outgoing to client [!code focus] [!code hl]
    fn new() -> Self { // [!code focus] [!code hl]
        Self // [!code focus] [!code hl]
    } // [!code focus] [!code hl]
    fn on_data(&mut self, user_id: &str, data: Self::Recv) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> { // [!code focus] [!code hl]
        log!("Got {:?} from {:?}", data, user_id); // [!code focus] [!code hl]
        Self::send(user_id, Pong) // [!code focus] [!code hl]
    } // [!code focus] [!code hl]
} // [!code focus] [!code hl]
```

The `new` method is called when our channel first opens, and the `on_data` method is called whenever we receive a message from a player.

## Connecting to a Channel (Client)

Last, we can hook up the client

::::steps

### Subscribe to the channel

Subscribe to the "ping pong" channel to get a `ChannelConnection` which we will call `conn`:

```rs
use turbo::*;

#[turbo::game]
struct GameState {}
impl GameState {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {}
    }
    fn update(&mut self) {
        if let Some(conn) = PingPongChannel::subscribe("default") { // [!code focus] [!code hl]
            // If we're in here, that means we connected the channel! [!code focus] [!code hl]
        } // [!code focus] [!code hl]
    }
}
```

### Receive messages from the channel

Pull Pong messages using the `ChannelConnection::recv` method:

```rs
use turbo::*;

#[turbo::game]
struct GameState {}
impl GameState {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {}
    }
    fn update(&mut self) {
        if let Some(conn) = PingPongChannel::subscribe("default") {
            while let Ok(msg) = conn.recv() { // [!code focus] [!code hl]
                log!("Received pong from server!"); // [!code focus] [!code hl]
            } // [!code focus] [!code hl]
        }
    }
}
```

### Send messages to the channel

Send a Ping message to the channel whenever the start button is pressed using the `ChannelConnection::send` method:

```rs
use turbo::*;

#[turbo::game]
struct GameState {}
impl GameState {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {}
    }
    fn update(&mut self) {
        if let Some(conn) = PingPongChannel::subscribe("default") {
            while let Ok(msg) = conn.recv() {
                log!("Received pong from server!");
            }
            if gamepad::get(0).start.just_pressed() { // [!code focus] [!code hl]
                let _ = conn.send(&Ping); // [!code focus] [!code hl]
                log!("Sent ping to the server!"); // [!code focus] [!code hl]
            } // [!code focus] [!code hl]
        }
    }
}
```

## Running your game

::::steps

### Review Your Code

Ensure that your `src/lib.rs` file is correct:

:::details[See full src/lib.rs source code]

```rs [src/lib.rs]
use turbo::*;

#[turbo::serialize]
pub struct Ping;

#[turbo::serialize]
pub struct Pong;

#[turbo::os::channel(program = "pingpong", name = "main")]
pub struct PingPongChannel;
impl ChannelHandler for PingPongChannel {
    type Recv = Ping; // incoming from client
    type Send = Pong; // outgoing to client
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self
    }
    fn on_data(&mut self, user_id: &str, data: Self::Recv) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
        log!("Got {:?} from {:?}", data, user_id);
        Self::send(user_id, Pong)
    }
}

#[turbo::game]
struct GameState;
impl GameState {
    fn update(&mut self) {
        // Subscribe to the "ping pong" channel to get a `ChannelConnection`
        if let Some(conn) = PingPongChannel::subscribe("default") {
            // Pull Pong messages using the `ChannelConnection::recv` method
            while let Ok(msg) = conn.recv() {
                log!("Received pong from server!");
            }
            if gamepad::get(0).start.just_pressed() {
                // Send a Ping message using the `ChannelConnection::send` method
                let _ = conn.send(&Ping);
                log!("Sent ping to the server!");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

:::

### Update your config

Update your `turbo.toml` file to include the following section:

```toml
[turbo-os]
api-url = "https://os.turbo.computer"
```

Next, create a free dev account at https://os.turbo.computer. The dashboard will have your user ID.

```sh
turbo run -w --user <YOUR_USER_ID>
```

It will prompt for a one-time password you can also find on your Turbo OS dashboard.

Once your game window opens, it will upload your program:

```sh
[turbo] Uploading "pingpong" (YOUR_PROGRAM_ID)...
[turbo] Uploaded "pingpong" (YOUR_PROGRAM_ID) âœ¨
```

When connects to the channel, you will see some output like the following:

```sh
[turbo] Channel connection open:
- program      : YOUR_PROGRAM_ID
- channel name : main
- channel id   : default
- inspector url: https://os.turbo.computer/channels/YOUR_PROGRAM_ID/main/default/inspector
```

If you press the start button on a gamepad or space on a keyboard, you will see the following output on the command line:

```sh
[turbo] Sent ping to the server!
[turbo] Received pong from server!
```

### Check the Channel Inspector

You can visit that "inspector url" to view the channel inspector page. There, you can observe messages sent to/from the server, user connection/disconnection events, and logs:

**This page is essential for debugging.** Use it to track server logs and channel activity.
