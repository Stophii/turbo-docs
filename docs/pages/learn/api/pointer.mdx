# Pointer

## Overview

The `Pointer` API provides a single interface for handling both mouse and touch inputs to maximize cross-platform compatibility.

## API

### `pointer`

Handles mouse and touch events simultaneously for easy cross-platform functionality.

```rust
pub fn pointer() -> Pointer
```

:::info
On mobile, swipes are treated as `gamepad` direction presses. See [`gamepad`](/learn/api/gamepad) for more details.
:::

:::details[`Pointer`]

```rs
pub struct Pointer {
    /// The x position of the mouse cursor or most recent touch event
    pub x: i32,
    /// The y position of the mouse cursor or most recent touch event
    pub y: i32,
    /// The state of the left mouse button or touch
    state: Button,
}
```

## Usage

### Using the pointer

```rust
let p = pointer();

// get the current mouse/touch position
let position_x = p.x;
let position_y = p.y;

if p.just_pressed() {
    // handle mouse click or touch event
}
```

:::note
Mouse clicks are treated identically to taps on mobile
