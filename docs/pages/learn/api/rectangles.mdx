## Overview

You can draw rectangles to your game's canvas using the `rect!` macro.

## API

### `rect!`

Draws rectangles.

```rust
rect!(
    w = u32,
    h = u32,
    x = i32,
    y = i32,
    color = u32,
    rotation = i32,
    border_size = u32,
    border_color = u32,
    border_radius = u32,
    fixed = bool,
    bounds = Bounds,
)
```

| Param           | Type     | Default      | Description                                                                |
| :-------------- | :------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `w`             | `u32`    | `0`          | Width of the rectangle in pixels.                                          |
| `h`             | `u32`    | `0`          | Height of the rectangle in pixels.                                         |
| `x`             | `i32`    | `0`          | X position of the left side of the rectangle in pixels.                    |
| `y`             | `i32`    | `0`          | Y position of the top side of the rectangle in pixels.                     |
| `color`         | `u32`    | `0xffffffff` | Color that fills the rectangle as RGBA hex.                                |
| `rotation`      | `i32`    | `0`          | Degrees of rotation. Positive clockwise. Negative counter-clockwise.       |
| `border_size`   | `i32`    | `0`          | Border width in pixels.                                                    |
| `border_color`  | `u32`    | `0x000000`   | Border color as RGBA hex.                                                  |
| `border_radius` | `u32`    | `0`          | Border radius in pixels.                                                   |
| `fixed`         | `bool`   | `false`      | If `true`, the rectangle's size and position are unaffected by the camera. |
| `bounds`        | `Bounds` |              | Sets the `x`, `y`, `w`, `h` of the rectangle.                              |

:::tip[Example - Basic]

Draw a rectangle with some basic options:

```rust
rect!(w = 20, h = 40, x = 70, y = 70, color = 0x0000ffff);
```

:::tip[Example - Advanced Usage]

Draw a rectangle with rotation and border options:

```rust
rect!(
    x = 112,
    y = 56,
    w = 32,
    h = 32,
    color = 0x0000ffff,
    rotation = 45,
    border_size = 2,
    border_color = 0xffffffff,
    border_radius = 4,
);
```
